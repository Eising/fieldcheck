#+TITLE: Fieldcheck

* Usage
Fieldcheck -u =username= -k =path/to/ssh_key= =device=

Runs the following checks on a Juniper EX device:

- ICMP: Is the device pingable
- SSH: Can the device be logged in to?
- OSPF: Does the device have at least two OSPF neighbors formed over different interfaces in any OSPF instance?
- Routing table: Does the device have at least one default route in any routing table

The device runs these tests and returns a JSON object.
